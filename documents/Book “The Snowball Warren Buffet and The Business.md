In a simple way, the more you have money, the more you can create more money. 

## Be Very Skeptical of New Paradigm

There’s no such thing as a new paradigm

For example in 1999, before the dotcom bubble, the stock position is expected to return 20% per year. People saying that buffet was crazy for not buying stock.

Buffet explain that only 3 cases where stock evaluation is motivated by:

1. Interest rate is low and will become lower
2. The share of the economy for the investor increases (This means employer and government get less)
3. Economy starts to grow faster

Warren said this position is wishful thinking.

> *Over the long run facts will be more important than opinions.*
> 

you’re right if you’re factually right and your reasoning right.

## Stay Within Your Circle of Competence

You’re investing in a business. you need to understand the underlying business.

## Use A Margin of Safety

Use margin of safety when buying a stock. For example, you should buy the company when the intrinsic value of a company is less than $50.

For example: you buy a stock when the market price is $40 and your valuation is $50.

> *Your profits from good decisions are not wiped out by the losses of your error*
> 

Buffet also learn the cigar butts method in his early life:

1. Cheap and unloved
2. Not the best one
3. Goof for one more puff

## Invest When There’s a Toll Bridge

Focus on cheap and dislike stock. You can also competitive stock.

> *It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.*

### Brands

For example, a coca cola company, it will be hard to compete with coca cola, since the new cola company will need to spend billions of dollar in marketing ads in order to match coca cola.

### Network effects

All social media brands are dependent on their individual creator for its platform value.

### Stickiness

When customer faces high switching cost, changing from company A product to B product. For example, tech company. A tech company will cost more money than the well established tech company.

### High Set-up Costs

If it takes a significant amount of money just to serve the first customer, competitors usually afraid to come to the market. For example, a rail company.

# Summary

- Compound interest is probably the most powerful wonder that you can access in order to become a millionaire and succeed in your investing. Use it to your advantage.
- Be very careful about new paradigms. If it sounds too good to be true, it is probably a bubble. The market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run.
- One of the best investing strategies both for beginners and advanced investors, is to stay within your circle of competence. Rule 1 in investing is to not lose money.
- As Warren Buffett has found out – and as Benjamin Graham taught him in his early career – it is easy to become rich as long as you insist on buying businesses that are worth $1, but that only costs $0.5. Use a margin of safety in all your investments.
- Companies listed on the stock markets are subject of tough competition – especially if they have high return on capital. Therefore, you should only invest in stocks that possess a competitive advantage – that is likely to persist in the future.
